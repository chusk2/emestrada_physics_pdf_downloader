## Download pdf files from exams website

I have created this custom script to download pdf files from a local A grades' exam page.  
The code is specifically designed to download pdf exams for Physics subject. Nonetheless, the code can be easily adapted to crawl links for other subjects in the website and retrieve their pdf links.
